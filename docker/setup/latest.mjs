// The newest release of each agent and toolchain, so a row can say "2.1.290 is
// available" without anyone asking - and, past that, the newest release mise
// is still holding back for toolchains and added tools. Agent updates take
// new stable releases immediately, without the release-age wait.
//
// `mise latest` asks a registry, which takes a second or two online and up to
// its timeout offline - far too slow and too flaky for a status poll. So it
// runs here in the background, one tool at a time, at most every hour (as
// often as T3 Code checks the same releases), and the answers are kept on the
// state volume so a restart starts warm. A poll only ever reads memory. A
// lookup that fails keeps the last answer: an unreachable registry is not news
// that the update went away.
